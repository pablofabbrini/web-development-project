        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <h3>Growing up</h3>
	<p>Hello, my name is Pablo Fabbrini and I am a junior majoring in IT. I live in Marietta Georgia and graduated from Pope High School. I have one brother who is currently a sophomore at UGA.
        What I do for fun is workout, play tennis and play video games. I currently work at Panda Express when I'm not in school or doing one of my hobbies.
    </p>

	<h3>College</h3>
	<p>My experience of the college life is life of a commuter student. I drive 20 minutes to KSU go to class and do what I need to do when not in class. 
        I don't party but I do enjoy hitting the ball with the KSU tennis club team. I have made a couple of friends there and sometimes we play and hang out outside of practice. 
    I enjoy college for the different types of opportunities it shows me such as academics, friends, career and just life in general. </p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Experience with Tech</h3>
	<p>I was first introduced to tech in 6th grade by doing activities on code.org. From then on I went from learning CSS, HTML, javascript, Java, C# and Python. Next language I am interested in learning would probably be SQL.
        I have built a website myself trying to replicate all the style, colors and functions of a professional website when I was in 8th grade. I was succesfull in making the replica of the website.
        My short term goal in tech is to get a masters in IT then long term tech goal would be to become CIO of a company.
    </p>
